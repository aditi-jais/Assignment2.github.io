    <h1>Laptop Screen</h1>
    <img src="images/laptopscreen.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The part of the laptop that you look at is called the display. Display is also a verb: your computer displays pictures, videos, and websites. Some people call this a screen, too.</p>
    <p>It has been proven that people perform better when they feel comfortable and they like details of their job, and working using a visually amazing display helps. Also, Dark mode emits less blue light, which reduces eye fatigue and blinking (dry eyes), especially in low light conditions.</p>
